Game Development Final Project Proposal

Requirements:
Minimum 5 minutes of gameplay.
A built application that functions on it’s own as a game.
It should be fun (or capture whatever emotion you are going for).
It can’t be a twin stick shooter.

Description:
A platformer where the main character can interact with creatures in a very themed scene.There will be lots of dialogue between the player and the other characters where decisions are made and paths will be followed. Core mechanics would be jumping, interactions/dialogue with characters, and there would be different interactions with other environments (like a sticky wall).

Very art based ! I want it to be more explorational as opposed to combat techniques. The art of the game is an important creation part for me.
